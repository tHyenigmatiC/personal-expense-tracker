We can't direclty create a .env file and use those values as process.env.KEY in our .ts/.tsx files.
The reason is typescript wants to know what are the types of those environment variables.
Thus to accomplish this we can follow the below solution

1. install package @types/node via npm or yarn
2. inside 'src' folder create a directory named 'types'.
3. within the 'types' folder create file 'environment.d.ts'
4. copy and paste the following code. This code is responsible for defining the types of
    nodejs variables i.e. variables defined inside '.env' files


    export {};

    declare global {
        namespace NodeJS {
            interface ProcessEnv {
                VARIABLE_NAME_SAME_AS_.ENV_FILE: type (eg: string, number);
                ..define the types of other variables same as this
            }
        }
    }
